/*
 
What is a Constructor?

 Constructor is a method that is called when an instance of a class is created.

Why do we need a constructor.

The intention is to put an object in an earlier state that is to initialize some of the fields in the

class.


public class Customer
{
    public Customer()
    {
    
    }
}
